Neoquest
========

Python 3 program to play Neopets RPG game. In development.
Refactoring and good UX will happen after all the zones are finished and I beat the game.

Example usage: `$ python grind.py -vvvv -s 0 -d 20` to move from the city to the desert
Example usage: `$ python grind.py -vvv` to grind in a single location

You will need to install requests and bs4, as specified in `requirements.txt`.
